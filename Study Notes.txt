Soon as a new user account is created, the following gets generated by default
1 VPC
1 IGW
4 Subnets
1 Route table
1 Network ACL
1 Security group

Interview questions:
1) IGW can be treated as your modem (that generally sits at your parking lobby)
2) Do we need IGW (Internet Gateway for intranet applications ?)
3) Can we have more than one IGW per VPC (Answer is No. There can be only one IGW per VPC)
4) You cannot detach a IGW when there are already a AWS resource running on it (E.g., EC2, RDS)

Route table contains a, 
1) Set of rules called routes that are used to determine where network traffic is directed
2) You can have multiple active route tables in a VPC

NACL: Network Access Control layer
1) This is an optional layer of security to your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets
2) Inbound and Outbond rules (E.g., allow HTTPS; Deny HTTP)
3) The default NACL, will ALLOW all inbound/outbound traffic. But if I create a new NACL, all inbound/outbound will be DENIED first. You can Edit it though
4) Associate Subnets to NACL
5) A subnet can be associated with ONE NACL at a time

Subnet: It is a sub-section of a network
1) If you think your ISP being a network, then your home network is considerd a subnet of your ISP's network
2) After creating a VPC, you can add one or more subnets in each AZ. Each subnet must reside entirely within one AZ and cannot span zones
